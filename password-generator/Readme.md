**Password Generator**
=====================

A simple password generator written in Go that generates strong and unique passwords.

**Usage**
-----

To run the password generator, save this code to a file named `password_generator.go` and run the following command:
```bash
go run password_generator.go
```
This will generate a password with a length of 12 characters, using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. You can customize the generated password by modifying the parameters to the `GeneratePassword` method.

**How it Works**
--------------

The password generator uses a random number generator to select characters from the selected character sets and concatenates them together to form a password.

**Features**
--------

* Generates strong and unique passwords
* Customizable password length and character sets
* Easy to use and integrate into your own Go programs

**Limitations**
------------

* Does not store or remember generated passwords
* Does not provide any guarantees about the strength or uniqueness of the generated passwords
